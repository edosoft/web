## Quick Start
This website has been built using Node.js, Bower and Grunt. 

First, a Node.js installation is required. It can be installed following the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
After Node.js is installed, Grunt, Karma and Bower are also required. They can be installed globally with the following command:

```sh
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
```

Afterwards, use the following commands on a directory of your choice to set up the development environment:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/edosoft/web-sites.git
$ cd web-sites/edosoft
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `web-sites/edosoft/build/index.html` in your browser. Alternatively, the `grunt watch` command should open a new tab on your browser with the compiled page.

Happy hacking!
